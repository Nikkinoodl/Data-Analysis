# Data-Analysis
Samples of a chatbot data analysis done by me. The tables in the spreadhseet were populated from an Access database via Microsoft PowerQuery. I have not included the raw data behind this analysis and I have anonymized data throughout.
It was used to help in decision making and to give an overall view of progress rather than as a polished management presentation.
For easy viewing, I have added the Excel spreadsheet as an html file - just open it in your browser.
