# Data-Analysis
Sample of a chatbot data analysis. The raw data was downloaded from a production database and uploaded to an Access database. Views were created to summarize this large dataset.
The summarized data was uploaded to tables in Microsoft Excel using Microsoft PowerQuery, from where further summarization was done.
The analysis was used to help in decision making and to give an overall view of progress rather than as a polished management presentation.
Some of the features required binning. In this example, we created a bin for those with more than 5 conversations captured a few outliers and made the data easier to put into a meaningful graph.

Some simple linear regression was performed to help understand trends:

Whenever possible, each chart was created to answer a business question:

By doing that, the analysis moved away from simple graphing of the data and became a way to understand the data from a more nuanced business viewpoint:

Splitting analysis between employee and no-employee users showed that the response from the more technology savvy users was different from that of the general public.
Inconsistencies in the distribution of ratings, among other things, required further analysis to understand whether this was a result of manipulation:
